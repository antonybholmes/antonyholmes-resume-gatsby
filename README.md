# Resume

Code base to make resume.

1. Run `npm run deploy` to create a running instance of the app on localhost:9000.
2. In a separate terminal, run `npm run pdf` to run create **antony_holmes_resume.pdf** using Puppeteer. You must have Google Chrome installed and accessible to Puppeteer otherwise you will need to change dependency `puppeteer-core` to `puppeteer`.
